## About

I'm a junior student majoring in Computer Science with Honors at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. Before this, I spent my freshman year at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>. My research focuses on developing ML/DL models to understand complex diseases and advance precision medicine. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://adaptinfer.org/people/">Prof. Ben Lengerich</a> on contextualized models for healthcare. I'm also actively working with <a href="https://liyu95.com/">Prof. Yu Li</a>, <a href="https://fanyimin-cuhk.github.io/">Yimin Fan</a>, and <a href="https://wangjiuming.github.io/homepage/">Jiuming Wang</a> at <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> on bioinformatics.

Previously, I worked on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at <a href="https://madability.cs.wisc.edu/">madAbility Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.yuhangz.com/">Prof. Yuhang Zhao</a> and <a href="https://ru-wang.com/">Ru Wang</a>
